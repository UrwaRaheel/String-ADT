String Abstract Data Type (ADT)
This project implements a String Abstract Data Type (ADT) in [insert programming language]. The String ADT provides a robust framework for manipulating and managing strings with essential operations such as insertion, deletion, concatenation, substring extraction, and searching.

Features
Dynamic Memory Management: Efficiently handles string allocation and deallocation.
Basic Operations: Supports fundamental string operations including:
Insert
Delete
Concatenate
Search
Substring extraction
Error Handling: Robust mechanisms for managing invalid operations.
